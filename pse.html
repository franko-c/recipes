        <p>Pad See Ew - which means “stir fried soy sauce noodles” - is an extremely popular Thai street food meal and one of the most popular noodles dishes at Thai restaurants.</p>

        <p><strong>making</strong> a great Pad See Ew at home simply comes down to two things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong class="deep-green">the right sauce!</strong> Basic recipes online will instruct you to use little more than just soy sauce and sugar. It takes a little more than that!</li>
            <li><strong class="earthy-peach">caramelising the noodles</strong> - getting a little caramelisation on the noodles makes all the difference between an “ok” and “wow, it’s JUST like you get at restaurants!”.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong class="burnt-orange">the trick?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>remove</strong> the stir fry ingredients. Cook the noodles with sauce separately. Less stuff in the wok (or skillet) = easier to caramelise the noodles.</p>
        <p><strong>if you’ve got</strong> a giant restaurant wok burner, you don’t need to do the noodles separately!</p>

    <section class="ingredients">
        <h2 class="center">ingredients</h2>
        <h3>for the sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce (for that rich, caramelized depth)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce (adds saltiness and balance)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>for the dish:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz wide rice noodles (fresh or pre-soaked if dried)</li>
            <li>1 cup protein (chicken, pork, tofu, or shrimp—whatever suits your mood)</li>
            <li>1 cup Chinese broccoli or bok choy (the crisp stems are a secret weapon for texture)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil (vegetable or peanut oil works best for high heat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>optional garnishes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>chilli flakes</li>
            <li>vinegar</li>
            <li>lime wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="center">instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="pale-lilac">prepare the sauce</li>
            <p>in a small bowl, mix the dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. this two-soy combo is where the magic begins.</p>
            <li class="burnt-orange">cook the protein</li>
            <p>heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until it’s almost smoking. Add oil and sear your protein until golden.</p>
            <p>“High heat is key,” Thai street vendors say, “to give your dish that coveted smoky ‘wok hei’ flavor.”</p>
            <li class="peach">add garlic</li>
            <p>toss in the minced garlic and stir-fry for 10–15 seconds. Don’t let it burn—just enough to release that irresistible aroma.</p>
            <li class="misty-rose">stir-fry noodles</li>
            <p>push the protein aside and add the rice noodles. Pour in the sauce and toss vigorously. Use tongs or a spatula to ensure every noodle gets coated.</p>
            <li class="dark-blue">vegetables</li>
            <p>add the Chinese broccoli or bok choy, stems first. Cook until tender but still crunchy, about 2–3 minutes</p>
            <li class="gold-ochre">serve and garnish</li>
            <p>plate it up hot, and if you’re feeling bold, sprinkle chili flakes or a splash of vinegar for some zing. Serve with lime wedges for brightness.</p>
        </ol>

        <ul>
        <h4 class="dark-blue">wok tip</h4>
        <li>a seasoned wok is like an artist’s brush — every dish you cook enhances its flavor. don’t have one? use a heavy-bottomed skillet and crank up the heat!</li>
        <h4 class="burnt-orange">noodle handling</h4>
        <li>fresh rice noodles are delicate, so handle them gently. if you’re using dried ones, soak them in warm water until soft but not mushy.</li>
        <h4 class="deep-green">flavor balance</h4>
        <li>the sauce is the soul of Pad See Ew. adjust the soy sauces to find the balance that suits your taste.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="serving-guide">
        <h2 class="center">serving guide</h2>
        <p>serve with a chilled Thai iced tea or a crisp cucumber salad to cool the palate.</p>
        <p>This dish is as much about the experience as it is about the flavor—gather your loved ones, grab some chopsticks, and enjoy it while it’s fresh off the pan.</p>
